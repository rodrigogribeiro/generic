Agda code for the article Generic Programming within Dependently Typed
Programming.

Comments
---------

    - Authors argument that using a large universe does not have
      advantages, since such universes do not have many generic
      operations over codes. So, using more specialised universes,
	  we can define more functions over its codes.

    - The article describes a library for Generic Haskell style of
      programming in a dependently typed language. Authors argument
      that the universe is accessible to the user.

    - The codes for data types are excessively clutter by kinds. This
      encoding uses a heavy notation that difficulty the
      comprehension. Sure that must be better encodings...
